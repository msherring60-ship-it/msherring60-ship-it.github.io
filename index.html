<h2> Reflection
Developing my career identity requires more than completing my degree and securing employment. It involves actively defining who I am professionally, what motivates me, and how I want to grow over time. Boyle (2022) argues that the Graduate Transition to Work (GTW) often acts as a turning point where graduates are forced to reassess their expectations about themselves and their careers. This challenged my assumption that clarity will simply emerge once I enter full-time work. If I rely only on experience without reflection, I risk shaping my career identity reactively rather than intentionally.
Boyle (2022) found that many Millennials delay serious career identity exploration during university and only begin refining their professional identity when workplace experiences expose misalignment. Reflecting honestly, I can see how easy it is to focus on achievement, grades, and progression without consistently questioning whether my decisions align with my intrinsic motivations. I have often measured progress through external milestones rather than internal alignment. This reading has reinforced that identity development requires deliberate self-examination, not just forward movement.
Brown (2015) argues that identity work is a continuous process in which individuals actively construct a coherent understanding of themselves while negotiating the social roles and expectations placed upon them. This perspective makes it clear that my professional identity will not simply appear once I graduate. It will develop based on how I interpret my experiences and whether I consciously adjust my direction. Instead of treating internships, projects, or roles as tasks to complete, I need to evaluate what they reveal about my preferred responsibilities, working style, and long-term aspirations.
Boyle (2022) also highlights that encountering misaligned work can strengthen intrinsic motivation rather than permanently lowering expectations. This aligns with Hall’s (2004) concept of the protean career, which emphasises self-directed and values-driven development. If I want to build a strong career identity, I must define success based on alignment with my values rather than relying solely on external measures such as salary or status. Clarifying whether I am motivated most by leadership, autonomy, impact, skill development, or stability will help me make more intentional decisions as I progress.
Additionally, Frazier and Hooker (2006) suggest that identity evolves through engagement with imagined future versions of the self (p. 44). Considering who I hope to become — and who I want to avoid becoming — can guide my exploration and strengthen motivation. Instead of seeking immediate certainty, I can approach new experiences as structured opportunities to test different professional directions. Each experience becomes feedback that sharpens my understanding of what fits and what does not.
Overall, developing my career identity requires proactive reflection, self-direction, and acceptance that revision is part of growth. Boyle (2022) demonstrates that identity development continues beyond graduation. By consciously engaging in identity work (Brown, 2015), adopting a self-directed mindset (Hall, 2004), and exploring future-oriented possibilities (Frazier and Hooker, 2006, p. 44), I can approach the GTW with clarity and adaptability rather than uncertainty. Career identity is not something I will passively discover; it is something I must deliberately construct and refine over time.
